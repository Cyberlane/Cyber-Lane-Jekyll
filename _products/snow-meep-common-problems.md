### The LEDs are mostly red
If the LEDs are mostly red, and the other colours have faded away, then your batteries need replacing.
<hr />
### Brand new batteries, and the turns flash very dim for a mere moment before stopping
This will happen when one of the LEDs is not wired in correctly, however if you look very closely at each LED you will notice there's a little slit on the positive side of the LED. You can use this to check your LEDs are in the right way around.
