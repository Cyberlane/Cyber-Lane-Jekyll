### The LEDs are mostly red
If the LEDs are mostly red, and the other colours have faded away, then your batteries need replacing. 
<hr />
### The tree doesn't turn on at all!
Check to see that the switch and the battery clips are on the same half of the tree. Unfortunately if they are not on the same side, it will not work at all. Fortunately, it's not too difficult to take the tree back apart to fix this, you just need to have access to a cheap solder sucker (around &pound;2 on eBay).
<hr />
### Brand new batteries, and the turns flash very dim for a mere moment before stopping
This will happen when one of the LEDs is not wired in correctly, however if you look very closely at each LED you will notice there's a little slit on the positive side of the LED. You can use this to check your LEDs are in the right way around.
