It's been quite a while since I've made a blog post, I haven't forgot about my blog, however I have been constantly busy with numerous other things! I am finally starting to get everything organized, so updates should start to become a bit more regular (finally!).

So let's update some of the projects I currently have running, and their status:

- CartoLogix for Windows [ on hold ]
- CartoLogix for Web [ re-drafting ]
- W3R File Parser/Blogger [ in progress ]
- XNA RTS Game [ in progress ]
- .NET MVC Forum Software [ drafting ]
- Developing Your Own Diagram Software Book [ in progress ]

I also have two long term development projects, which unfortunately are confidential, so I am unable to mention  details of their development until completion.

CartoLogix for Windows is currently on hold, as I am in the process of converting it into a book describing how to develop your own Diagram Software in C#. I have not yet tried to find a publisher for the book, as I first want to complete a couple major chapters which I think would be beneficial for the publishing companies to give me a fair judgement, on whether they will publish my work or not.

CartoLogix for Web, the original project, which took me a lot of time to develop, I have decided to re-draft, as I am sure I can re-develop all of the existing features to be faster and more stable than they are at present. I also believe that I can do all of this in a mere fraction of the original development time, with a few tricks I have learned over the past year. I'll be posting updates on the project progress in future blog posts.

W3R File Parser/Blogger, is a small project I have undertaken. I was asked to create a plugin for WordPress, which allows the user to upload a W3R file, which will first be parsed for information, and then uploaded to a public FTP. The parsed information and Link to the file will be automatically posted into a new blog post, and blog formatting options will also be available.

XNA RTS Game, a Real Time Strategy game I am currently developing with Microsoft's XNA Framework. I have a full development team on this project, of which, I am the lead programmer. I will be making use of the Lua Scripting language for this project, and releasing the game on the Xbox 360 Marketplace.

.NET MVC Forum Software, something I have wanted to do for ages is write my own Forum Software, a good software package, which is written in .NET, offers a lot of flexibility, ease of use, stability, and it best of all, open source (free to use).

That covers pretty much everything that is going on at the moment, I also need to redesign my homepage at some point, as the scale of work I am now undertaking has come to be a bit too much for the current design to handle.
