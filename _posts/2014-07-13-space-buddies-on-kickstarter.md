description: My first Kickstarter campaign is live!

I have just launched my first Kickstarter campaign for an electronics kit which teaches more than just soldering.
{{ more }}

![001](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/297710079/space-buddies)

The kit will teach you regular soldering, as well as surface mount. It also comes with a booklet teaching you everything you need to know about basic circuits, sound waves, controlling RGB LEDs, data transfer over infrared LEDs as well basic understanding of programming in C! The kit is completely open source, and the programming headers are exposed so you can completely change the game into whatever you want it to be!﻿

I am basically looking to make a well rounded educational item, and if I can reach at least £1000, I will be speaking to a professional illustrator to ensure the booklet looks that little bit more professional. I have a lot of hopes running on this project, and really hope it takes of well! Who knows, it might even end up on sale in some stores, but here's to wishful thinking!

Anyway, I would love some support from anybody who can and even if you are unable to support my campaign, please share it with your friends!
