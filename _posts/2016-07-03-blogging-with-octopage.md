description: I have started using Octopage
---

Yesterday I discovered an app for iOS which allowed me to write my Jekyll blog posts. {{ more }}

The app is called [Octopage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopage-blogging-jekyll-markdown/id649843345). It is far from perfect when it comes to actually typing the content of the blog posts, but it allows me to create offline drafts, handles all of my customized headers, and just works. I hope the developer will spend more time on polishing up this app, as it is great for when I am not near a computer and have some ideas I want to share. I made this blog post with the app, as proof of it working!
