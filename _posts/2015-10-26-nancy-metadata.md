description: I wrote a little code with NancyFX for metadata
---

Last week I was struggling to find out how to make good use of metadata within [NancyFx](http://www.nancyfx.org/). I was reading through their extensive [documentation](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki) along with searching Google for answers. {{ more }} The closest I could find was a [single blog post](http://liddellj.com/nancy-metadata-modules/) written by [Jim Liddell](https://twitter.com/liddellj) and unfortunately it did not cover the specifics of what I wanted to try and achieve.

I wanted to provide metadata for specific routes within specific modules, in a clean and structured manner. I did not want to add any extra layers of complexity, I just wanted something simple that just worked. I spent a few hours trying to get it working with how I believed it should be working, based off of the methods in the framework but unfortunately kept on hitting runtime errors. So in the end, I created a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Cyberlane/9dbcc37fff85777716f1) of what I was trying to do, and sent it to [Andreas HÃ¥kansson](http://www.thecodejunkie.com/) via email, asking what I was doing wrong.
A couple of days later, he came back to me with [the answer](https://gist.github.com/thecodejunkie/7c14b0541165442ef062) and of course at that moment I instantly realised how it all worked. This was still not what I wanted as an end result, but by knowing how the framework worked, I could make it work the way I wanted.

I wanted to be able to create a MetadataModule file for each Module that I wanted to provide Metadata for, and have it work with paths that were relative (the base path) to what was already found my existing Nancy Modules. So this is what I did...

I created an interface named IDataModule, that would allow me to have a structured way of retrieving my information from each of my MetadataModule files.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Cyberlane/2176bb99faf21b7d2381.js"></script>

Along with a simple object structure that would serve as my Metadata itself.

I then created an instance of a MetadataModule file, but I decided to try and keep a bit of structure to this, just to make my life a little easier. So currently all my Nancy Modules live in a folder named **Modules** so I decided my Metadata files should live in a folder named **Metadata**. I also decided that since my Modules have the naming convension of **NameModule** that my Metadata should have a matching convension, so a matching file would be **NameMetadataModule**. So for **HomeModule** I would then have a matching **HomeMetadataModule** file.

Now for this all to work, I needed an IRouteMetadataProvider instance, which supported all these rules I put into place. It is perhaps not the cleanest implementation, but it works perfectly for my needs.

Now in my instance usage case, I wanted this to store an index position so that I could create an object for generating a navbar. I used a very simple object for storing my navbar.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Cyberlane/4dd93e117f56a2414b58.js"></script>

I then created a simple method for reading the data for me, including the Metadata, from the IRouteCache instance.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Cyberlane/ba5a61cfced3b299938d.js"></script>

I will most likely create some improvements on this in the near future, but for now, it works perfectly for what I need and perhaps this will serve as useful for others.
