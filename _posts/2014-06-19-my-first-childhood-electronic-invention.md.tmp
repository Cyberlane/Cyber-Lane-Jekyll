One more long overdue blog post covering what I have been up to recently, and hopefully a few more over the next few days/weeks.

Back in 1991, I was 7 years old and there were two collectable toys that were all the rage for kids my age. One was `Monster in my pocket`, and the other was `The Trash Bag Bunch`.
I collected both, however the latter inspired me more than the former. The Trash Bag Bunch came in little green trash bags made out of some type of tissue paper, and inside the bag was a small ball of bicarbonate of soda. You basically had to fill a sink with warm water, lower the trash bag into the sink and watch as the water would slowly turn into a swamp, bubbling away and turning green. Once the bubbling stopped you would then put your hand into the swamp and pull out your monster, and as a kid I loved this! Now I honestly cannot remember if it came with one of my monsters or if my parents bought it separately but there was a special ball I remember getting for the slime that it would make in the bathroom sink. This little white ball was a bit bigger than a pingpong ball, it had two metallic pads on it which if touched by your skin would activate it, making it flash a red light and play a very creepy haunted house type of tune. The intention was that you put the ball on top of the swamp water in the sink, and it would activate itself as the surface of the water was conductive.

I absolutely loved this little ball and would always play with it, but my curious nature got the better of me and one day I decided to take it apart and try to see how it all worked. I had no idea how the actual microchip inside worked, but I worked out enough to see how I could trigger the circuit to play whenever I wanted it to, and how to stop it accordingly. This led onto my first electronic invention at the age of 8.
