So overall I was a big fan of this protein powder, so much so that I finished it a little faster than usual (more snacks on protein shakes than on protein bars) but unfortunately at the time of writing this post, it is [no longer stocked]((http://www.gymgrossisten.com/1/sv/artiklar/100-whey-gold-standard) by [GymGrossiten](http://www.gymgrossisten.com/).
