I have had a few people asking me for help with numerous things related to jQuery, and have noticed that they are quite repetitive questions, so I have decided to create this blog {{ more }} which will contain a series of tutorials with code snippets I have made, which should help bring some light on many questions.

My most recent set of questions were in regards to jQuery and XML, so I am going to go through this as best I can, and if anybody needs any further clarifications, please feel free to leave me some comments.
