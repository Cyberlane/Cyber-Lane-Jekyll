description: Playing around with Silverlight
---
Once again, I have been really busy with numerous different things. I have been teaching myself Microsoft Silverlight, {{ more }} reading a bit more into AJAX for ASP.NET, as well as playing around with a few other languages. As an experiment, I have started to convert CartoLogix into Silverlight, as I have a feeling it would run much better as a Silverlight application, if it is intended for use over the web.

I am also going to be starting a new job at William Reed Business Media, as a Junior Online Solutions Developer. I am looking forward to playing around with all the new ideas and new technology they work with, which will include Microsoft Silverlight.

When I get a bit more time, I will do a bit more of a global update on everything on this website, but unfortunately I have been away either working or traveling.
