description: A small learning curve, but I can handle it
---
Well I have been working for William Reed for nearly a month now, and I must say I am loving it! I am learning so much, {{ more }} getting to play around with all the tech and such that I normally only get to mess around with in my free time, and get to speak to people who actually know what they are talking about!

So far, I have learned jQuery (I used to be highly proficient in JavaScript, but now I can code even more, in less time), even wrote my own jQUery Plugin. I have also been learning LINQ, MVC, nHibernate, Resharper, and a few other bits. I am to also learn ENDECA very soon, which looks like a very interesting item to work with.

I am already making good use of all this knowledge, as they keep giving me small projects to try out, while they train me up.

New job aside, I have decided to write some User Controls of my own, as I have tried out many different controls (commercial and open source) and none of them do exactly what I would like them to do. Some offer a lot of features I like, but then they have hidden problems. So I have decided to develop my own, which I would have better control over. I may even publish them if I feel they are good enough.
