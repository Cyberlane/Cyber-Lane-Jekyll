This has been one crazy busy year! I have been doing a lot of intense client work with GraphQL, React and Redux, along with interviewing a lot of people looking to join [tretton37](https://tretton37.se). On top of that, I have been working on some personal projects which I am hoping to reveal later this year! {{ more }}

The official KidSpeak event website has been launched at [Kidspeak.se](https://kidspeak.se) where you can now sign up for the event being held in Lund, Sweden, on the 22nd of July (2017). There will also be a Stockholm event announced in the next couple of days, we are just trying to make it fit around people's vacations. These events will be a repeat of what was held at [Leetspeak 2016](https://leetspeak.se/2016/), however there will be something completely new at [Leetspeak 2017](https://leetspeak.se/2017/)! Lots more great things are coming, so stay tuned!
