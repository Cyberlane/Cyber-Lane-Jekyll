### What is Cyber-Lane?

Cyber-Lane is a persona that I (Justin Nel) picked up when I moved from Jo'burg, South Africa to England back in 2001. The name was originally the name of a small Internet Cafe around the corner from where I lived. I have never been great with coming up with names for anything, and always liked the term "cyber" when it came to anything digital, so I kind of adopted the name as there was nothing over in the UK (nor anywhere else from what I could tell at the time) with the same name. I have been holding the name for a good number of years now, and it seems that there are now just two Cyber-Lanes, the Internet Cafe back in South Africa (which has now become a stationary supply company), and me.

### So who is Justin Nel?

Well I have already mentioned where I am from in the previous paragraph, but for those of you who want to know. I am a software developer that is currently finding his way around making his own electronics. My mother was a punch card programmer (and worked at the company that invented the ATM), and got me into computers at an early age. I have been writing code since I was 6 years old, taught programming (among other subjects) as a College, sold an adventure game engine with tools that I wrote to a Japanese company at the age of 16. I have since done work with the UK military, a law firm in Barbados, big publishing companies, postal couriers. law firms and even Amazon. I have made printer drivers for warehouse label printers that out perform anything else on the market, software that can read and write to a custom file type with better error handling than the people who made it, single handedly ported a windows application into a multi-platform web based application that had more features and out performed the original application, among a number of other feats.

### What are you doing now?

At the beginning of 2015 I emigrated from England to Sweden, and now I am work as a Ninja for [tretton37](www.tretton37.com).
