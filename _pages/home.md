### Christmas Soldering Workshops in Brighton

It's Christmas time and I have made up some Christmas themed soldering kits! You can see them in the Products section of my website.

If you want to a great little Snow-Meep badge, or really cool little Christmas tree then I will be selling them online on my website. I will also be selling them in person at Build Brighton every Saturday (from November 30<sup>th</sup> 2013) up until Christmas. So if you need some help assembling the kit(s), please do come along to Build Brighton! I am trying to organise with the other members of Build Brighton to host their own workshops on the same days so that there is a bit more variety.
